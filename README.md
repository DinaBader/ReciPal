###  Coffee Express is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the React Native framework. React native is an open-source JavaScript framework, designed for building apps on multiple platforms like iOS, Android, and also web applications, utilizing the very same code base. It is based on React, and it brings all its glory to mobile app development.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the MongoDB package which allows storing data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time.
- The app uses the Imagga technologie for image recognition. Imagga offers powerful image recognition and tagging capabilities, allowing the application to analyze and understand the content of images with precision.
- For translation, the app uses i18n (internationalization). i18n provides a robust framework for managing translations and localizations within the application.
